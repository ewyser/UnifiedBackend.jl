## Overview

This package is an evolution of the somewhat cumbersome-to-use [`ep2-3De v1.0`](https://github.com/ewyser/ep2-3De), and is entirely written in **Julia**. It is designed for **rapid prototyping** while maintaining **reasonable production capabilities**. It addresses the following key aspects:

- **Updated Lagrangian explicit formulation** for elastoplastic simulations.
- Supports both **finite** and **infinitesimal deformation** frameworks:
  - **Finite deformation**: employs logarithmic strains and Kirchhoff stresses.
  - **Infinitesimal deformation**: based on a **Jaumann rate** formulation.
- Compatible with multiple **shape function bases**:
    - Standard linear shape function $N_n(\boldsymbol{x}_p)$
    - GIMP shape function $S_n(\boldsymbol{x}_p)$
    - Boundary-modified cubic B-spline shape function $\phi_n(\boldsymbol{x}_p)$
- Provides mappings between nodes (denoted $n$ or $v$) and material points (denoted $p$), using:
    - FLIP with augmented mUSL procedure
    - TPIC with standard USL procedure

The solver can generate initial fields $f(\boldsymbol{x})$—such as the cohesion $c(\boldsymbol{x}_p)$ or internal friction angle $\varphi(\boldsymbol{x}_p)$—using random Gaussian fields, with $\boldsymbol{x}_p$ representing a material point’s coordinate.
